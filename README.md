# Task 1 - Python Basics

Intern Name: Raut Kajal Mahadev
Date: 5 May 2025

## Description

This notebook (`task1_python_basics.ipynb`) includes basic Python practice:
- Variable declarations and rules
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and membership operators
- Simple use cases with printed outputs and explanations

# Task 2 - Python built-in Data Types-Key concepts and Methods
Intern Name:Raut Kajal Mahadev
Date:6 May 2025 Day2:Create notebooks for:Numbers,String,List and Tuple.

Number Data Types:int,float,complex Type conversion using int(),float(),complex(),type() function to identify data types example,
expressions and point outputs

String Data Types:How to create strings using'',"",and''' ''' string indexing and slicing methods like upper(),lower(),replace(),split() 
string formating using f"",format()Escape characters and raw strings

List Data Types:How to define and access list items List slicing,nested lists Mutable nature of lists List methods:.append(),.insert(),.removed(),
.pop(),.sort(),.reverse() in keyword for membership

Tuple Data Type:How to create tuples using () differences between lists and tuples Tuple indexing and slicing use of tuples in functions and dictionary keys

Date: 7 May 2025 Day 2 :Create notebooks for Set, Dictionary

Set Data Type : This notebook explains the set data type in python. It includes: Defination Creating set using different methods. common operation: union, intersection, difference add(), remove(), union(), intersection(), clear().

Dictionary Data Type: How to create dictionary using {} Dictionary indexing, membership common methods/ function : get(),keys(),values(), items(),update(),pop().

# Task 3
Intern Name:Raut Kajal Mahadev
Date:8 May 2025
This notebook covers essential Python control flow tools used in decision-making and iteration. Each section is designed with clear examples and explanations to help learners understand the logic and usage of different flow-control statements.

Section 1: Conditional Statements if Statement if-else Statement if-elif-else Statement

Section 2: for Loop Iterating through lists, strings, and ranges

Section 3: while Loop Looping based on condition Infinite loop handling

Section 4: Control Statements break: Exit the loop early continue: Skip current iteration pass: Placeholder for future code

# Task 4
Date:9 May 2025

This notebook explains the various function in python.

-User-defined functions for logical operations like Armstrong check, vowel counting, HCF, etc.

-Lambda functions for compact anonymous operations (e.g., cube, conversions).
# Task 5
Date:10 May 2025

This notebook demonstrates various functionalities of the NumPy library, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. The goal of this task is to explore key NumPy features including:
-  Installation and import of NumPy
  
- Creating arrays manually and using built-in functions
  
- Performing basic arithmetic and statistical operations on arrays
  
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays
  
- Advanced operations such as broadcasting and aggregation

-Filter functions to extract specific data from lists.

-Map functions to apply transformations to iterable data.

-Format functions for clean string output.
